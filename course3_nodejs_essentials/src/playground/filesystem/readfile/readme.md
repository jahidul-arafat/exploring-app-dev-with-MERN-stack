## An overview of the architecture of `readfileStreamEnhanced.js` in bullet points:

1. Module Imports:
    - Uses `fs.promises` for asynchronous file operations
    - Imports `createReadStream` from 'fs' for streaming file content
    - Uses `readline` for handling user input
    - Imports `EventEmitter` for custom event handling

2. Global Variables:
    - Defines file path and initializes data structures for storing file chunks

3. Main Components:
    - `determineChunkSize`: Dynamically calculates appropriate chunk size based on file size
    - `readFile`: Core function for reading file contents using streams
    - `askQuestion`: Promisified function for user input
    - `promptUser`: Handles user interaction for viewing file chunks

4. File Reading Process:
    - Uses `createReadStream` to read file in chunks
    - Emits custom events for chunk reading, completion, and errors

5. Event-Driven Architecture:
    - Utilizes custom `EventEmitter` (fileEmitter) for handling file reading events
    - Implements event listeners for 'error', 'chunkRead', and 'readComplete' events

6. Asynchronous Operations:
    - Leverages async/await for handling asynchronous file operations and user prompts
    - Uses Promises for better flow control and error handling

7. User Interaction:
    - Implements a readline interface for capturing user input
    - Allows users to view specific chunks of the file or quit the program

8. Error Handling:
    - Implements try-catch blocks for error management
    - Emits error events for centralized error handling

9. Modular Design:
    - Separates concerns into distinct functions (e.g., file reading, chunk size determination, user prompting)

10. Scalability Considerations:
    - Dynamically adjusts chunk size based on file size for efficient memory usage
    - Uses streaming to handle potentially large files without loading entire content into memory

11. Recursive Approach:
    - Uses recursive calls in `promptUser` for continuous user interaction

12. Clean-up and Exit:
    - Implements a 'close' event listener on the readline interface for proper program termination

This architecture demonstrates a well-structured, event-driven approach to handling large file reading and user interaction in Node.js, with a focus on asynchronous operations and efficient resource management.
